# Krypto-Project
In this project I am using flask and I have created three rest Api endpoint 
first API is for giving the target at which I wast to get triggered so for that I have created a used get and post
and second API  is created for for the userâ€™s to delete an alert `alerts/delete/` if user do not want to get an alert 
this methid makes him able to disable the alert
 last api  is created to fetch all the alerts that the user has created when the user want to fetch all the 
 API then this function get invoked
and all
